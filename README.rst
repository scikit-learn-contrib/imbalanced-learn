imbalanced-learn
================

imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques
commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance.
It is compatible with scikit-learn_ and is part of scikit-learn-contrib_
projects.

Documentation
-------------

Installation documentation, API documentation, and examples can be found on the
documentation_.

.. _documentation: https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

imbalanced-learn is tested to work under Python 3.6+.
The dependency requirements are based on the last scikit-learn release:

* scipy(>=0.17)
* numpy(>=1.11)
* scikit-learn(>=0.21)
* joblib(>=0.11)
* keras 2 (optional)

Additionally, to run the examples, you need matplotlib(>=2.0.0) and
pandas(>=0.22).

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

imbalanced-learn is currently available on the PyPi's repository and you can
install it via `pip`::

  pip install -U imbalanced-learn

The package is release also in Anaconda Cloud platform::

  conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn

If you prefer, you can clone it and run the setup.py file. Use the following
commands to get a copy from GitHub and install all dependencies::

  git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn.git
  cd imbalanced-learn

Most classification algorithms will only perform optimally when the number of
samples of each class is roughly the same. Highly skewed datasets, where the
minority is heavily outnumbered by one or more classes, have proven to be a
challenge while at the same time becoming more and more common.

One way of addressing this issue is by re-sampling the dataset as to offset this
imbalance with the hope of arriving at a more robust and fair decision boundary
than you would otherwise.

Re-sampling techniques are divided in two categories:
    1. Under-sampling the majority class(es).
    2. Over-sampling the minority class.
    3. Combining over- and under-sampling.
    4. Create ensemble balanced sets.

Below is a list of the methods currently implemented in this module.

* Under-sampling
    1. Random majority under-sampling with replacement
    2. Extraction of majority-minority Tomek links [1]_
    3. Under-sampling with Cluster Centroids
    4. NearMiss-(1 & 2 & 3) [2]_
    5. Condensed Nearest Neighbour [3]_
    6. One-Sided Selection [4]_
    7. Neighboorhood Cleaning Rule [5]_
    8. Edited Nearest Neighbours [6]_
    9. Instance Hardness Threshold [7]_
    10. Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbours [14]_
    11. AllKNN [14]_

* Over-sampling
    1. Random minority over-sampling with replacement
    2. SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique [8]_
    3. bSMOTE(1 & 2) - Borderline SMOTE of types 1 and 2 [9]_
    4. SVM SMOTE - Support Vectors SMOTE [10]_
    5. ADASYN - Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning [15]_

* Over-sampling followed by under-sampling
    1. SMOTE + Tomek links [12]_
    2. SMOTE + ENN [11]_

* Ensemble classifier using samplers internally
    1. Easy Ensemble classifier [13]_
    2. Balanced Random Forest [16]_
    3. Balanced Bagging

The different algorithms are presented in the sphinx-gallery_.
