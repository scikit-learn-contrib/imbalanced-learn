imbalanced-learn
================

imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance.
It is compatible with scikit-learn_ and has been submitted to be part of scikit-learn-contrib_ projects.

About
=====

Most classification algorithms will only perform optimally when the number of samples of each class is roughly the same. Highly skewed datasets, where the minority is heavily outnumbered by one or more classes, have proven to be a challenge while at the same time becoming more and more common.

One way of addresing this issue is by re-sampling the dataset as to offset this imbalance with the hope of arriving at a more robust and fair decision boundary than you would otherwise.

Re-sampling techniques are divided in two categories:
    1. Under-sampling the majority class(es).
    2. Over-sampling the minority class.
    3. Combining over- and under-sampling.
    4. Create ensemble balanced sets.
    
Below is a list of the methods currently implemented in this module.

* Under-sampling
    1. Random majority under-sampling with replacement
    2. Extraction of majority-minority Tomek links [1]_
    3. Under-sampling with Cluster Centroids
    4. NearMiss-(1 & 2 & 3) [2]_
    5. Condensend Nearest Neighbour [3]_
    6. One-Sided Selection [4]_
    7. Neighboorhood Cleaning Rule [5]_
    8. Edited Nearest Neighbours [6]_
    9. Instance Hardness Threshold [7]_
    10. Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbours [14]_

* Over-sampling
    1. Random minority over-sampling with replacement
    2. SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique [8]_
    3. bSMOTE(1 & 2) - Borderline SMOTE of types 1 and 2 [9]_
    4. SVM SMOTE - Support Vectors SMOTE [10]_
    5. ADASYN - Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning [15]_

* Over-sampling followed by under-sampling
    1. SMOTE + Tomek links [12]_
    2. SMOTE + ENN [11]_

* Ensemble sampling
    1. EasyEnsemble [13]_
    2. BalanceCascade [13]_

The different algorithms are presented in the following notebook_.
