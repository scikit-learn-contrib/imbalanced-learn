imbalanced-learn
================

imbalanced-learn is a python package offering a number of re-sampling techniques
commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class imbalance.
It is compatible with scikit-learn_ and is part of scikit-learn-contrib_
projects.

About
-----

If you use imbalanced-learn in a scientific publication, we would appreciate
citations to the following paper::

  @article{JMLR:v18:16-365,
  author  = {Guillaume  Lema{{\^i}}tre and Fernando Nogueira and Christos K. Aridas},
  title   = {Imbalanced-learn: A Python Toolbox to Tackle the Curse of Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning},
  journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},
  year    = {2017},
  volume  = {18},
  number  = {17},
  pages   = {1-5},
  url     = {http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-365}
  }

Most classification algorithms will only perform optimally when the number of
samples of each class is roughly the same. Highly skewed datasets, where the
minority is heavily outnumbered by one or more classes, have proven to be a
challenge while at the same time becoming more and more common.

One way of addressing this issue is by re-sampling the dataset as to offset this
imbalance with the hope of arriving at a more robust and fair decision boundary
than you would otherwise.

You can refer to the `imbalanced-learn`_ documentation to find details about
the implemented algorithms.
