UnbalancedDataset
=================

UnbalancedDataset is a python module offering a number of re-sampling
techniques commonly used in datasets showing strong between-class
imbalance.

Most classification algorithms will only perform optimally when the number of
samples of each class is roughly the same. Highly skewed datasets, where the
minority heavily outnumbered by one or more classes, haven proven to be a
challenge while at the same time becoming more and more common.

One way of addresing this issue is by re-sampling the dataset as to offset this
imbalance with the hope of arriving and a more robust and fair decision
boundary than you would otherwise.

Resampling techniques are divided in two categories:
    1. Under-sampling the majority class(es).
    2. Over-sampling the minority class.

Bellow is a list of the methods currently implemented in this module.

* Under-sampling
    1. Random majority under-sampling with replacement
    2. Extraction of majority-minority Tomek links
    3. Under-sampling with Cluster Centroids
    4. NearMiss-(1 & 2 & 3)
    5. Condensend Nearest Neighbour
    6. One-Sided Selection
    7. Neighboorhood Cleaning Rule

* Over-sampling
    1. Random minority over-sampling with replacement
    2. SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
    3. bSMOTE(1&2) - Borderline SMOTE of types 1 and 2
    4. SVM_SMOTE - Support Vectors SMOTE

* Over-sampling follow by under-sampling
    1. SMOTE + Tomek links
    2. SMOTE + ENN

* Ensemble sampling
    1. EasyEnsemble
    2. BalanceCascade

This is a work in progress. Any comments, suggestions or corrections are
welcome.
