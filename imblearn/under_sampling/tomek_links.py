    """Class to perform under-sampling by removing Tomek's links.

    Parameters
    ----------
    return_indices : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether or not to return the indices of the samples randomly
        selected from the majority class.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by np.random.

    n_jobs : int, optional (default=-1)
        The number of threads to open if possible.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_c_ : str or int
        The identifier of the minority class.

    max_c_ : str or int
        The identifier of the majority class.

    stats_c_ : dict of str/int : int
        A dictionary in which the number of occurences of each class is
        reported.

    X_shape_ : tuple of int
        Shape of the data `X` during fitting.

    Notes
    -----
    This method is based on [1]_.

    It does not support multi-class sampling.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    >>> from imblearn.under_sampling import TomekLinks
    >>> X, y = make_classification(n_classes=2, class_sep=2, weights=[0.1, 0.9],
    ...                            n_informative=3, n_redundant=1, flip_y=0,
    ...                            n_features=20, n_clusters_per_class=1,
    ...                            n_samples=1000, random_state=10)
    >>> print('Original dataset shape {}'.format(Counter(y)))
    Original dataset shape Counter({1: 900, 0: 100})
    >>> tl = TomekLinks(random_state=42)
    >>> X_res, y_res = tl.fit_sample(X, y)
    >>> print('Resampled dataset shape {}'.format(Counter(y_res)))
    Resampled dataset shape Counter({1: 897, 0: 100})
