Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in :class:`under_sampling.NearMiss` which was not picking the right samples during under sampling for the method 3. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`ensemble.EasyEnsemble`, correction of the `random_state` generation. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_ and `Christos Aridas`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`under_sampling.RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours`, add additional stopping criterion to avoid that the minority class become a majority class or that a class disappear. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`under_sampling.AllKNN`, add stopping criteria to avoid that the minority class become a majority class or that a class disappear. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`under_sampling.CondensedNeareastNeigbour`, correction of the list of indices returned. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`ensemble.BalanceCascade`, solve the issue to obtain a single array if desired. By `Guillaume Lemaitre`_.
- Fixed a bug in :class:`pipeline.Pipeline`, solve to embed `Pipeline` in other `Pipeline. By `Christos Aridas`_ .
- Fixed a bug in :class:`pipeline.Pipeline`, solve the issue to put to sampler in the same `Pipeline`. By `Christos Aridas`_ .
