Version 0.10.0 (ongoing)
========================

Changelog
---------

Deprecation
...........

- The parameter `n_jobs` has been deprecated from the classes
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.ADASYN`,
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.BorderlineSMOTE`,
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE`,
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTENC`,
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTEN`, and
  :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SVMSMOTE`. Instead, pass a nearest neighbors
  estimator where `n_jobs` is set.
  :pr:`887` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- The fitted attribute `estimator_` in
  :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.CondensedNearestNeighbour`
  has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.12. Instead, use the
  `n_neighbors_` fitted attribute.
  :pr:`891` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Enhancements
............

- Add support to accept compatible `NearestNeighbors` objects by only
  duck-typing. For instance, it allows to accept cuML instances.
  :pr:`858` by :user:`NV-jpt <NV-jpt>` and
  :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Add support to accept compatible `KNearestNeighbors` objects that can be
  clone and have an attribute `n_neighbors`.
  :pr:`891` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.
