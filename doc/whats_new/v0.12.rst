==================================

Changelog
---------

Bug fixes
.........

- Fix a bug in :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NeighbourhoodCleaningRule` where the
  `kind_sel="all"` was not working as explained in the literature.
  :pr:`1012` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Fix a bug in :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NeighbourhoodCleaningRule` where the
  `threshold_cleaning` ratio was multiplied on the total number of samples instead of
  the number of samples in the minority class.
  :pr:`1012` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Compatibility
.............

- :class:`~imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier` now support missing values
  and monotonic constraints if scikit-learn >= 1.4 is installed.

- :class:`~imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline` support metadata routing if scikit-learn >= 1.4
  is installed.

Deprecations
............

- Deprecate `estimator_` argument in favor of `estimators_` for the classes

  :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.OneSidedSelection`. `estimator_` will be removed
  in 0.14.
  :pr:`1011` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Deprecate `kind_sel` in :class:`~imblearn.under_sampling.NeighbourhoodCleaningRule.
