# SPIDER-Weak / SPIDER-Relabel
###############################################################################

###############################################################################
# Both SPIDER-Weak and SPIDER-Relabel start by labeling whether samples are
# 'safe' or 'noisy' by looking at each point's 3-NN and seeing if it would be
# classified correctly using KNN classification. For each minority-noisy
# sample, we amplify it by the number of majority-safe samples in its 3-NN. In
# the diagram below, the amplification amount is indicated by the number of
# solid lines for a given minority-noisy sample's neighborhood.
#
# We can observe that the leftmost minority-noisy sample will be duplicated 3
# times, the middle one 1 time, and the rightmost one will not be amplified.
#
# Then if SPIDER-Weak, every majority-noisy sample is removed from the dataset.
# Othewise if SPIDER-Relabel, we relabel their class to be the minority class
# instead. These would be the samples indicated by a circled plus-sign.

# SPIDER-Strong
###############################################################################

###############################################################################
# SPIDER-Strong still uses 3-NN to classify samples as 'safe' or 'noisy' as the
# first step. However for the amplification step, each minority-noisy sample
# looks at its 5-NN, and if the larger neighborhood still misclassifies the
# sample, the 5-NN is used to amplify. Otherwise if the sample is correctly
# classified with 5-NN, the regular 3-NN is used to amplify.
#
# In the diagram below, we can see that the left/rightmost minority-noisy
# samples are misclassified using 5-NN and will be amplified by 5 and 1
# respectively. The middle minority-noisy sample is classified correctly by
# using 5-NN, so amplification will be done using 3-NN.
#
# Next for each minority-safe sample, the amplification process is applied
# using 3-NN. In the lower subplot, all but one of these samples will not be
# amplified since they do not have majority-safe samples in their
# neighborhoods. The one minority-safe sample to be amplified is indicated in a
# darker neighborhood with lines.
