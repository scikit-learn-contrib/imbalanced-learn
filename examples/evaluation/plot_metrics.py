=======================================
Metrics specific to imbalanced learning
=======================================

Specific metrics have been developed to evaluate classifier which
has been trained using imbalanced data. :mod:`imblearn` provides mainly
two additional metrics which are not implemented in :mod:`sklearn`: (i)
geometric mean and (ii) index balanced accuracy.

# We will split the data into a training and testing set.

# We will create a pipeline made of a :class:`~imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE`
# over-sampler followed by a :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` classifier.

# Now, we will train the model on the training set and get the prediction
# associated with the testing set. Be aware that the resampling will happen

# in `y_test`.

# The geometric mean corresponds to the square root of the product of the
# sensitivity and specificity. Combining the two metrics should account for
# the balancing of the dataset.
